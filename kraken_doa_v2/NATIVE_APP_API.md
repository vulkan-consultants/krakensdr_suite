# Heimdall DoA Client — Native App / WebSocket API

This document is for developers building a native client (Android/iOS app,
desktop tool, script) that controls the DoA client and consumes its live
streams. **The native API is the same WebSocket the browser UI uses — there is
no separate port or protocol.** Anything the web UI can do, a native client can
do by speaking this protocol.

- **Endpoint:** `wss://<host>:8080/ws` (TLS/WSS, binary + text frames)
- **Direction:** text commands go *up*; binary stream frames + JSON status come
  *down*.
- **State model:** the backend is the single source of truth. Every
  state-changing command is echoed to *all* connected clients as
  `{"sync_cmd":"<command>"}`, so multiple clients (e.g. the browser and your
  app) stay in sync automatically.

---

## 1. TLS / certificate (TOFU)

Port 8080 uses a **self-signed** certificate (`server.crt`, `CN=krakensdr`).

- The certificate is generated per install (`server.key` is not shipped), so
  its fingerprint **differs between devices** — you cannot ship a fixed
  certificate pin in the app.
- Use **trust-on-first-use (TOFU)**: accept the certificate on first connect,
  remember its fingerprint, and pin it thereafter (the SSH model).
  - **iOS:** add an ATS exception for the host and implement
    `URLSessionDelegate urlSession(_:didReceive:completionHandler:)` to evaluate
    the server trust yourself (store/compare the leaf cert on first use).
  - **Android:** supply a `network-security-config` / custom `X509TrustManager`
    that trusts the remembered certificate.

---

## 2. Connection handshake

```
1. Open WSS to wss://<host>:8080/ws   (binaryType = arraybuffer)
2. AUTH      (only if a token is configured — see below)
3. SUBSCRIBE (optional — choose which streams you receive)
4. ... send commands / receive frames ...
```

### 2a. Authentication (`AUTH:`)

Auth is **optional and fail-open**: if the server has no token configured, no
authentication is required and you may skip this step entirely.

- On connect, if a token is required the server sends
  `{"auth_required":true}`.
- Send **`AUTH:<token>`** as your **first** text message (before any command).
- On success: the server subscribes you and replays current state (see §3); no
  explicit "ok" is sent — the state replay is your signal.
- On failure: the server sends `{"auth_error":"invalid token"}` and closes the
  socket with code **1008** (policy violation).

If no token is configured, sending `AUTH:<anything>` is a harmless no-op.

> The token is configured server-side via the `KRAKEN_API_TOKEN` environment
> variable or an `api_token` file next to the binary. Use an alphanumeric
> token. The browser receives it automatically (injected into the served page).

### 2b. Stream subscription (`SUBSCRIBE:`)

By default a client receives **all** streams. To save bandwidth (e.g. a phone
that doesn't need the ~246 KB/s FFT firehose), send:

```
SUBSCRIBE:FFT,AUDIO,DOA      # any subset; or "ALL"; or empty for control-only
```

- Selectable streams: **`FFT`**, **`AUDIO`**, **`DOA`**.
- The control channel (`sync_cmd` echoes, scanner/DoA state, `system_status`)
  is **always** delivered regardless of subscription — it's required for
  correct multi-client state sync.
- The server acks with `{"subscribed":{"fft":<bool>,"audio":<bool>,"doa":<bool>}}`.
- You may re-`SUBSCRIBE` at any time to change the set.

---

## 3. State replay on (re)connect

Immediately after subscribing (on connect when fail-open, or right after a
successful `AUTH`), the server pushes the current state so your UI can
initialize:

- `{"scanner_sync":{...}}` — current scanner state.
- A series of `{"sync_cmd":"<command>"}` messages — the latest value of each
  replayed setting (topology, radius, MUSIC params, FM/DoA toggles, etc.).

Apply these the same way you'd apply a user action. Frequency/gain/channel and
averaging are *not* replayed here — they arrive continuously in the FFT frame
header (§5.1).

---

## 4. Control commands (text, sent up)

Send commands as plain UTF-8 text frames. Format is `KEY:value` (or a bare
keyword for actions). All settings exposed in the web UI are covered. Numbers
are decimal; booleans are `1`/`0` unless noted.

### Tuning / RF
| Command | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `FREQ:<MHz>` | Set center frequency (float MHz). Exits wideband mode if active. |
| `WIDEBAND_FREQ:<MHz>` | Set center frequency while staying in wideband mode. |
| `GAIN:<dB>` | Set RF gain (float dB) for the active channel. |
| `CHANNEL:<n>` | Select active channel (display + FM), `0..MAX_CHANNELS-1`. |
| `FREQ_OFFSET:<kHz>` / `FREQ_OFFSET_1:<kHz>` / `FREQ_OFFSET_2:<kHz>` | Per-decimator offset by position. |

### Demodulation / audio
| Command | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `FM:<0\|1>` | Enable/disable FM audio. |
| `DEMOD_MODE:<mode>` | Global demod mode (per-decimator form is `SET_DECIMATOR_DEMOD`). |
| `BANDWIDTH:<idx>` | Global bandwidth index (per-decimator form is `SET_DECIMATOR_BW`). |
| `AVG:<alpha>` | FFT averaging coefficient (0..1). |

### Decimators
| Command | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ADD_DECIMATOR` | Add a decimator. |
| `REMOVE_DECIMATOR:<id>` | Remove decimator by id. |
| `SET_DECIMATOR_FREQ:<id>:<Hz>` | Set a decimator's frequency offset. |
| `SET_DECIMATOR_BW:<id>:<idx>` | Set a decimator's bandwidth (index into `BANDWIDTH_OPTIONS`). |
| `SET_DECIMATOR_DEMOD:<id>:<mode>` | Set a decimator's demod mode. |
| `SET_FM_DECIMATOR:<id>` | Choose which decimator feeds FM audio. |
| `GET_DECIMATOR_INFO` | Query → replies `{"decimator_info":[...]}`. |

### DoA / array geometry
| Command | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `DOA:<0\|1>` | Enable/disable MUSIC DoA. |
| `TOPOLOGY:<UCA\|ULA\|CUSTOM>` | Array topology. |
| `RADIUS:<mm>` | UCA radius. |
| `SPACING:<mm>` | ULA element spacing. |
| `CUSTOM_POSITIONS:<...>` | Custom element positions. |
| `ELEVATION_RESOLUTION:<deg>` | Elevation scan resolution (3D arrays). |
| `MUSIC_NUM_SNAPSHOTS:<n>` / `MUSIC_SNAPSHOT_LENGTH:<n>` | Covariance snapshots / length. |
| `MUSIC_SIGNAL_SOURCES:<n>` | Expected number of signal sources (signal-subspace dim). Clamped to `0..elements-1`; `0` = automatic per-frame estimation (an eigenvalue counts as a source when ≥6 dB above the noise-eigenvalue mean AND within 12 dB of the dominant eigenvalue, with 3-frame hysteresis) (the live estimate is reported as `est_sources` in `system_status.decimator_squelch`). |
| `ULA_MODE:<FORWARD\|BACKWARD\|BOTH>` | ULA front/back truncation. Resolves the linear-array mirror ambiguity by zeroing one half-plane of the pseudospectrum (forward = within ±90° of 0°). No effect unless topology is `ULA`. Default `BOTH`. |
| `ARRAY_OFFSET:<deg>` | Array orientation offset (0–359) added to the reported bearing; rotates the pseudospectrum so it aligns with the array's physical mounting. Applies to all topologies. Default `0`. |
| `MUSIC_FB_AVERAGING:<0\|1>` | Forward-backward covariance averaging. Doubles the effective snapshot support and partially decorrelates coherent multipath. Only valid for a centro-symmetric array, so it is applied only while topology is `ULA` (inert otherwise). Default `0`. |
| `MUSIC_COVARIANCE_ALPHA:<a>` | Temporal covariance smoothing across updates: `R_avg = (1-a)*R_avg + a*R_frame`. `a` is the newest-frame weight, clamped to `0.05..1.0`; `1.0` = off (default). The average resets on retune/topology/config changes. |
| `EDGE_CLIP:<pct>` | Wideband stitch edge clip. |

### Beamforming
| Command | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `BEAMFORMING:<0\|1>` | Enable/disable. |
| `BEAMFORMING_MODE:<DAS\|FREQ_DAS\|MVDR\|DIVERSITY>` | Mode. |
| `MVDR_DIAGONAL_LOADING:<a>` / `MVDR_SNAPSHOTS:<n>` | MVDR regularization / snapshots. |
| `MANUAL_STEERING:<0\|1>` / `STEERING_ANGLE:<deg>` | Manual steer on/off + angle. |

### Squelch
| Command | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `DEC_SQUELCH_ENABLE:<id>:<0\|1>` / `DEC_SQUELCH_LEVEL:<id>:<v>` | Per-decimator squelch enable / FFT-peak threshold (dB). |
| `DEC_SQUELCH_METHOD:<id>:<FFT\|EIGEN\|EIGEN_AUTO>` | Per-decimator squelch method: FFT peak, eigenvalue ratio with manual threshold, or auto eigenvalue (self-learned threshold = idle-λ floor × 2.5, min 1.3; floor learning is FFT-gated — frozen while an in-band FFT peak ≥ 7 dB above the normalized noise floor is visible (DC bins excluded, and only when valid FFT data exists) — so landing on a continuous transmission keeps the threshold unlearned (0 = open) until the first quiet moment, while elevated coherent noise floors with no FFT peak are learned and squelched; relearns whenever the VFO frequency moves). The λ ratio comes from that decimator's MUSIC covariance. While the squelch is CLOSED the published DoA output freezes at the last open frame for every method, including with beamforming active (FFT skips MUSIC; the eigen modes keep computing the ratio but suppress the pseudospectrum/peak/stamp update, with ~1 dB hysteresis so a ratio hovering at the threshold can't flutter the display; under beamforming MUSIC keeps computing and steering holds the last open bearing). The DoA output is also hard-frozen — all methods, squelch on or off — while heimdall is calibrating (noise source active + settle hold). |
| `DEC_SQUELCH_EIGEN:<id>:<v>` | Per-decimator eigenvalue-ratio threshold (linear, clamped `1..1e6` — strong signals reach ratios of 1e4–1e5). |

### FFT display
| Command | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `FFT_SIZE:<n>` | FFT size. |
| `FFT_DECIMATION:<n>` | On-wire bin decimation (bandwidth lever for the FFT stream). |
| `GET_FFT_SETTINGS` | Query → replies with FFT settings JSON. |

### Wideband / scanner
| Command | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `WIDEBAND_MODE:<0\|1>` / `WIDEBAND_BASE_FREQ:<MHz>` | Wideband enable / base freq. |
| `SCANNER_LOAD_CONFIG:<...>` / `SCANNER_GET_CONFIG` | Scanner config load / query. |
| `SCANNER_START` / `SCANNER_STOP` / `SCANNER_PAUSE` / `SCANNER_RESUME` / `SCANNER_NEXT` | Discrete scanner control. |
| `SCANNER_SET_SQUELCH:<v>` / `SCANNER_SET_DWELL:<ms>` | Discrete scanner params. |
| `CONTINUOUS_SCANNER_START` / `CONTINUOUS_SCANNER_STOP` / `CONTINUOUS_SCANNER_STATUS` | Continuous scanner control. |
| `CONTINUOUS_SCANNER_SQUELCH:<v>` / `CONTINUOUS_SCANNER_DWELL:<ms>` / `CONTINUOUS_SCANNER_DECAY:<s>` | Continuous scanner params. |
| `CONTINUOUS_SCANNER_WIDEBAND:<0\|1>` / `CONTINUOUS_SCANNER_WIDEBAND_RANGE:<start>:<end>` | Continuous scanner wideband. |

### Browser-only display prefs (`UI:`)
`UI:WF_COLORMAP`, `UI:WF_MIN`, `UI:WF_MAX`, `UI:WF_SPEED`, `UI:WF_AUTO`,
`UI:FFT_Y` are **client-side display preferences**. The backend does not
interpret them — it only relays them to other browsers for display sync. A
native app renders its own display and does not need these; you may send them to
keep open browsers in sync, but they have no backend effect.

## 5. Stream frames (binary, received down)

All binary frames are **little-endian**. The first `uint32` is the message
**type**. Frames are self-delimited by the WebSocket framing itself (one logical
message per WS binary frame).

### 5.1 FFT — type `0` (topic `fft`, ~20/s)
Header, then arrays:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| type | uint32 | `0` |
| num_channels | uint32 | active channel count |
| decimation_factor | uint32 | RF decimation in effect |
| center_freq | float32 | MHz |
| gain | float32 | dB |
| averaging_alpha | float32 | 0..1 |
| channel_marker | uint32 | `0x80\|ch` = compressed single channel; `ch` = uncompressed; `0xFE` = wideband compressed; `0xFF` = wideband uncompressed |
| num_bins | uint32 | may be `0` when no data — then no arrays follow |
| frequencies | float32 × num_bins | per-bin center frequency (MHz) |
| min_envelope | uint8 × num_bins | compressed magnitude (min of bin group) |
| max_envelope | uint8 × num_bins | compressed magnitude (max of bin group) |

**Magnitude decompression:** `dB = value * (120.0 / 255.0)` (the encoder maps
dB range `[0,120]` → `uint8 [0,255]`). Each bin carries both the min and max
magnitude within its decimation group (draw as a vertical span).

### 5.2 Beamformed FFT — type `4` (topic `fft`)
Same layout/decoding as type 0; only sent while beamforming is enabled.

### 5.3 Audio — type `1` (topic `audio`, ~25/s)
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| type | uint32 | `1` |
| sample_count | uint32 | PCM samples this packet represents (1920) |
| sample_rate | float32 | 48000 |
| opus_size | uint32 | bytes of Opus payload |
| opus_data | uint8 × opus_size | Opus packet — mono, 48 kHz, 40 ms frames |

Decode with any Opus decoder (the browser uses `opus-decoder`). VBR ~32 kbps.

### 5.4 DoA — type `3` (topic `doa`, ~5/s)
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| type | uint32 | `3` |
| decimator_count | uint32 | number of blocks following |

Then, repeated `decimator_count` times:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | uint32 | decimator id |
| freq_offset_khz | float32 | |
| bandwidth_index | uint32 | index into `BANDWIDTH_OPTIONS` |
| num_angles | uint32 | e.g. 360 |
| array_radius | float32 | |
| blocks_processed | uint32 | cumulative |
| resolution | float32 | degrees/bin (fixed at 1.0 — the grid is always 360 bins; sub-degree bearings come from peak interpolation) |
| pseudospectrum | float32 × num_angles | **linear** magnitude per azimuth bin |
| is_3d | uint32 | 0 = 2D (azimuth only), 1 = 3D |
| *(if is_3d=1)* num_elevation | uint32 | |
| *(if is_3d=1)* elev_resolution | float32 | degrees |
| *(if is_3d=1)* peak_elevation | int32 | degrees |
| *(if is_3d=1)* elev_spectrum | float32 × num_elevation | linear magnitude |

Peak azimuth = argmax of `pseudospectrum`; map to your display convention (the
browser/Android compass page uses `(360 - bearing) % 360`). For a sub-grid
readout, refine the argmax with a 3-point parabolic fit on
`ln(pseudospectrum)` around the peak (circular indexing; skip if a neighbor
bin is `0.0` from ULA masking) — this is what the backend does for the bearing
it logs and serves on `DOA_value.html` (one-decimal degrees).

The `pseudospectrum` already reflects `MUSIC_SIGNAL_SOURCES`, `ULA_MODE`, and
`ARRAY_OFFSET`: the array offset is baked into the bin angles (bin `i` →
`i * resolution` degrees in world frame), and ULA forward/backward truncation
zeroes the masked half-plane (those bins arrive as `0.0`). No client-side
correction for these settings is needed.

## 6. Control/status messages (JSON text, received down)

Delivered on the always-on control channel:

- `{"auth_required":true}` — send `AUTH:` (handshake).
- `{"auth_error":"..."}` — bad token; socket closing.
- `{"subscribed":{"fft":..,"audio":..,"doa":..}}` — `SUBSCRIBE` ack.
- `{"sync_cmd":"<command>"}` — another client (or this one) applied a command;
  re-apply to your UI to stay in sync.
- `{"scanner_sync":{...}}`, `{"doa_state":{"enabled":bool}}` — state pushes.
- `{"system_status":{...}}` (~2/s) — `hw` (cpu_temp, cpu_pct, ram), squelch
  state (`decimator_squelch[]` with per-decimator `open`, `eigen_ratio`, `eigen_peak` — 5 s peak hold — `eigen_thr` effective threshold, `est_sources`), `beamforming_status`, phase state, etc.
- `{"decimator_info":[...]}` — reply to `GET_DECIMATOR_INFO`.

---

## 7. Quick test (websocat)

```bash
# Fail-open (no token): stream control-plane only, then enable DoA
websocat --insecure wss://<host>:8080/ws <<<'SUBSCRIBE:DOA'

# With a token:
printf 'AUTH:%s\nSUBSCRIBE:FFT,DOA\nDOA:1\n' "$TOKEN" \
  | websocat --insecure wss://<host>:8080/ws
```

(`--insecure` accepts the self-signed cert for testing — a real app uses TOFU.)

## rf.service.v1 DoA stream (Phase 2)

A lightweight client can request only structured MUSIC estimates with the existing
TLS WebSocket on port 8080:

    SUBSCRIBE:DOA_SERVICE

The server publishes one UTF-8 JSON text message per enabled decimator whenever
the 200 ms DoA publication timer runs and calibration is not active.  This is a
separate pub/sub topic from the legacy binary `DOA` stream, so existing web/native
clients are unchanged.

Each message is an `rf.service.v1` envelope with `type="doa_estimate"`.  It carries
the MUSIC result commit system-clock and monotonic epochs, an interpolated GNSS
epoch from the latest gpsd TPV observation, timing quality/uncertainty, frequency,
bandwidth, sub-degree array azimuth, elevation when available, MUSIC confidence,
FWHM-derived 1-sigma angular uncertainty, eigenvalue-ratio power metric,
calibration/squelch state and decimation factor.

The angular sigma is an estimator-quality measurement, not the final geographic
LOB uncertainty.  `rf_payload_link` later combines it with vehicle attitude,
mounting, timing and navigation uncertainty.
