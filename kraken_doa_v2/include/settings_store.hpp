// Backend persistence of user settings.
//
// A canonical schema (settings_store.cpp) lists every remembered setting with
// its command prefix, JSON type and hardcoded default. The full set of settings
// is serialized to a JSON file (doa_settings.json) - seeded with defaults on
// first run - and restored on startup by replaying each setting through the
// normal control handler. Persistence lives on the backend, so it is shared by
// every browser rather than being per-browser.
namespace SettingsStore {
    // Populate the in-memory store from the JSON file, filling any missing keys
    // with their defaults and (re)writing the file so it always holds the full
    // set. Creates the file with all defaults on first run. Call once at startup.
    void load();

    // Every setting as a "PREFIX:value" command, in schema order, for replay.
